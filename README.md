## What's this repo for?
This is the companion repo to my [blog post on logging in .NET](https://rachelmeadows.substack.com/p/a-wizards-guide-to-ilogger). It's an alteration of the '.NET with React' template and is neither beautiful, nor functional. But! It does what it needs to, which is to teach people about logging.

### Things you might like to do with this repo:
- Run the application and look at the logs
- Experiment with changing the log level
- Try changing the logging provider and log to a different source

## How do I get started?
1. Clone the repo
2. The default run scripts weren't working on my machine, so run it through Visual Studio (this is probably fixable, but not worth it for a throwaway project).
5. Enjoy üê∏
